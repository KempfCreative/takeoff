This is Forked from a great, simple extension from **[@ryanmcgrath](http://twitter.com/ryanmcgrath)** from **[here](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/takeoff)**.

Takeoff
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was up late one night, and my brain was in one of those modes where I needed
a new, really quick project to distract myself from what I was currently working
on. Sometimes that kind of thing helps the brain to get to a better solution.

I noticed someone on Reddit by the name of [hokku was looking for an extension](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fjb0v/is_there_a_chrome_extension_that_can_set_my/)
to randomly choose a bookmark and load it on new tab/window instances. I took
20 minutes and knocked this together. It's open source, as I have zero interest
in maintaining it; feel free to learn from it to build your own, or fork it and
run with it as you see fit. MIT licensed.


To Install
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download it, unzip it somewhere, load it up in your **[extensions tab](chrome://extensions/)** by loading
an "unpacked" extension. Or, just drag and drop...easy. NOTE: You must enable developer tools to get this to work.
